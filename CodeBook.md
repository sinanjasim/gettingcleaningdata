## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

##Collecting the data 
Data was collected from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
##Data Gathering
Data was merged in one file 
##Required Features 
Required features were extracted and used to get the data for these variables only
##Naming the features 
Freatures were named to get every variable in one column
##Averaging 
Data were averaged for two groups subject and Activities. That we got the number 
of every subject for every Activity. 
##Saving the file
Data was saved in a file.

##Subjects 
There as 30 `subject` were involved in the experiment

## Activity Labels
The values are given to the activities and these activities is the situation of
the subject during the test
* (value `1`) `WALKING` : subject was walking 
* (value `2`)`WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking up a staircase
* (value `3`)`WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking down a staircase
* (value `4`)`SITTING`: subject was sitting 
* (value `5`)`STANDING`: subject was standing
* (value `6`)`LAYING`: subject was laying down
